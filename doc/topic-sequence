1st block: Overview of the relevant Python library modules – getting familiar with the dataset, generating plots to examine feature/class distributions.
2nd block: Introduction to ML – k-Nearest Neighbor Classification – train-validation-test procedure
3rd block: Pre-processing – data type conversion, normalization, feature selection…
4th block: Performance evaluation – ROC, Precision-recall… overfitting
5th and 6th blocks: 2-3 classification algorithms – e.g. Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Neural Networks – classification as a whole including pre-processing and performance evaluation
7th block: Deep Learning – convolutional neural networks
8th block: Regression; Unsupervised learning - clustering (k-means, PCA, TSNE)
